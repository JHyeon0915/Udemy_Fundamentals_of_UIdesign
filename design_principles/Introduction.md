# Introduction
### 4 Design Principles

1. Contrast
    1. Can be created within fonts, buttons, background color, and etc
    2. The element of scarcity is the reason that we wanna have contrast because **we donâ€™t have infinite amount of attention of the user.**
2. Repetition
    1. Used to union things that already are the visually same element
3. Alignment
    1. Used to improve readability
    2. Ex) navigation and logo
4. Proximity
    1. Distance between two elements
    2. The hardest in the 4 principles
    3. The space between elements implies a relationship
