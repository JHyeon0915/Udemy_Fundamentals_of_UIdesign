# Alignment
**Purpose**

- To improve the readability of a screen or a page

**3 popular alignment types**

1. center
    * Easy
    * Overused
    * No grab of attention as much
2. left
    * When text is left but button is center, the button pops up on the eyes
    * If it seems random, it’s not good. But if looks intentional, it’s good
3. right
    * no info

**Conclusion**

- Try centered heading and buttons and left-aligned common info
- Find out what you like
- Do not use only centered alignment
