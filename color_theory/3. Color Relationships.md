# Color Relationships
Color relationship is about how to combine colors to create contrasts

## Complementary relationship

- Meaning that The color that is across your base color in the color wheels
- Ex) If Yellow is the base color, the accent color will be Purple
- But in this case, the contrast is too big → **not used in mobile apps** since it tires eyes very quickly

## Triadic relationship

- Once you pick out your base color, the colors, in the equal distance to the both left and right, will be the accent colors
- Very balanced harmonic relationship

## Analogous

- Pick the base color and the next colors to its right and left but only little.
- A good choice between trial and monochromatic
- **Enable people to stare at the screen for a long time**

## Monochromatic

- Pick only one color and adjust brightness or transparency
- Looks really sophisticated and very popular in the mobile world
- Not much contrast but that’s why it is **popular in the mobile** world cause it doesn’t tire the eyes
